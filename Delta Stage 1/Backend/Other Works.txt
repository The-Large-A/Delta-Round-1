For the Smart India Hackathon I learned most of Flutter in a weekend and a half and was supposed to use that to make a mobile application for our project if we had gotten selected

Unfortunately the judgew barely vivited our team and we werent prepared so we didnt get selected

Also Did the ppt and was supposed to sell the project to the Judges but never got the chance
RIP
